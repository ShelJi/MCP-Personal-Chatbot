## Overview

Here's a comprehensive blueprint for building your full-stack AI-powered personal chatbot system. This project will leverage the cutting-edge Model Context Protocol (MCP) and powerful open AI models to create a conversational interface for your GitHub presence, offering intelligent insights into your coding prowess.

## Core Architecture

A Symphony of Modern Technologies

Your application will be a robust, full-stack solution with a clear separation of concerns. The backend, powered by Django, will serve as the central nervous system, orchestrating AI agents and managing data. The frontend will provide a seamless conversational experience for users.

### Backend

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that will handle user authentication, database management (for storing user information and chat history), and serve as the foundation for our MCP server.
- **Fastmcp**: The heart of our AI orchestration. MCP provides a standardized way for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data. We will use fastmcp, a Pythonic library, to create MCP servers that expose our GitHub analysis functionalities as "tools" that the AI agents can utilize.
- **django-mcp-server**: This package will be instrumental in seamlessly integrating our fastmcp tools within our Django project, allowing us to expose Django model querysets and custom methods as MCP tools.
- **OpenAI Models**: We will leverage the power of models like GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4 for their exceptional conversational abilities and reasoning skills. These models will act as the "brain" of our chatbot, understanding user queries and deciding which MCP tools to use.
- **uv Package Manager**: For a modern and significantly faster development workflow, we will use uv to manage our Python dependencies and virtual environments.

### Frontend

- **React or Vue.js**: A modern JavaScript library will be used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface for the chatbot.
- **WebSockets**: To enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the frontend and the Django backend for a smooth conversational flow.

## System Design: Conversational Flow

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how a user interaction will be processed:

1. **User Query**: The user types a question into the chatbot interface (e.g., "What are my most starred repositories?" or "Analyze the code quality of my 'portfolio' project.").
2. **Frontend to Backend**: The frontend sends the user's query to the Django backend via a WebSocket connection.
3. **Django Receives**: The Django view receives the message and initiates the fastmcp orchestration process.
4. **AI Agent (OpenAI Model) Invocation**: The user's query is passed to an OpenAI model. The model is prompted to act as a "GitHub Analyst" and is provided with a list of available MCP tools.
5. **MCP Tool Selection**: The OpenAI model analyzes the user's intent and determines the most appropriate MCP tool to call. For instance, to find the most starred repositories, it would select the get_user_repositories tool.
6. **fastmcp Execution**: The fastmcp server executes the selected tool. This tool will contain the logic to interact with the GitHub API using a library like PyGithub.
7. **GitHub API Interaction**: The tool makes the necessary API calls to GitHub to fetch the requested data (e.g., repository details, profile information, or even file contents for code analysis).
8. **Data Return**: The data from the GitHub API is returned to the fastmcp tool.
9. **Response Generation**: The returned data is then passed back to the OpenAI model. The model processes this data and formulates a natural, human-like response.
10. **Backend to Frontend**: The Django backend sends the generated response back to the frontend through the WebSocket.
11. **Display to User**: The chatbot interface displays the intelligent answer to the user.

## AI Agent Roles with fastmcp

We will define a suite of specialized AI agents (as MCP tools) to handle various aspects of GitHub analysis. These tools will be decorated with `@mcp.tool()` within our Django project.

**ProfileAgent:**

- `get_user_profile(username: str) -> dict`: Fetches general profile information.
- `get_user_stats(username: str) -> dict`: Retrieves statistics like follower count, number of public repositories, etc.

**RepositoryAgent:**

- `get_user_repositories(username: str, sort: str = 'stars', direction: str = 'desc') -> list`: Lists a user's repositories with sorting options.
- `get_repository_details(username: str, repo_name: str) -> dict`: Gets detailed information about a specific repository.
- `get_repository_languages(username: str, repo_name: str) -> dict`: Analyzes the language distribution in a repository.

**CodeAnalysisAgent:**

- `analyze_code_quality(username: str, repo_name: str, file_path: str) -> str`: (A more advanced feature) This tool could fetch the content of a file and use another AI model or a static analysis tool to provide a high-level code quality assessment.

## Development Roadmap

A Phased Approach

Here's a suggested roadmap for building your MCP Personal Chatbot:

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Foundation

- Initialize your project directory and set up a uv virtual environment.
- Install Django, fastmcp, and django-mcp-server.
- Configure your Django project, including database setup.
- Set up your GitHub App for API access and obtain credentials.

### Phase 2: MCP Server and Basic AI Agents

- Create your first fastmcp tools within a Django app to fetch basic GitHub profile information.
- Integrate the django-mcp-server to expose these tools.
- Write initial logic to pass a hardcoded query to an OpenAI model and see it call your MCP tool.

### Phase 3: Conversational Frontend

- Set up a React or Vue.js project for the frontend.
- Implement a basic chat interface.
- Establish a WebSocket connection between the frontend and your Django backend.

### Phase 4: Advanced Agents & Conversational Logic

- Develop more sophisticated fastmcp agents for repository analysis and code inspection.
- Refine the prompting for the OpenAI model to handle a wider range of conversational queries.
- Implement context management to allow for follow-up questions.

### Phase 5: User Authentication & Deployment

- Implement user authentication in Django to allow users to securely connect their own GitHub accounts.
- Prepare your application for deployment. Consider platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
- Thoroughly test the end-to-end functionality.
